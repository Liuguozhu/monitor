## Manual package

```bash
mvn clean assembly:assembly
```

After the package is complete, a `pybbs.tar.gz` file will be generated in the target directory under the project root directory, extract it and run `sh start.sh` to start the forum service.

In addition, the tar.gz file generated after manual packaging is the latest release package in the release on github. After downloading, the extracted content is the same.
